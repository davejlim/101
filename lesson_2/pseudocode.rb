# For example, write out pseudo-code (both casual and formal) that does the following:

1. a method that returns the sum of two integers

Given two integers
Sum two integers
Print

START
Given two integers
SET integer1
SET integer2
SET SUM = integer1 + integer2
Print SUM

2. method that takes an array of strings, and returns a string that is all those strings concatenated together

Given array of strings
Concatenate strings
Return concatenated strings

3. method that takes an array of integers, and returns a new array with every other element

Given array of integers
Iterate through the array one by one
  - Assign the first value to the new array
  - Skip the next value
  - Assign the next value to the new array
  - Do the above until the original array of integers has been assigned or skipped
